<dt><h3>The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act,2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years as a Fundamental Right.The Right of Children to free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act means that every child has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.<p>

Article 21-A and RTE Act came into effect on 1 April 2010.The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words 'free and compulsory'.'Free education' means that no child,other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government,shall be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementry education.'Compulsory education'casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission,attendence and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group.With this,India has moved forward to a rights based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Government to implement this fundamental child right as inshrined in the Article 21A of the Constitution,in accordance with the provision of the RTE Act.</dt></h3><p>
